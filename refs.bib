abstract = {High entropy alloys (HEA), a novel class of materials with multiple principal elements, allow us to tune the properties within a wide composition range where the solid-solution phase is stable. However, it is difficult to experimentally determine the boundaries of the single-phase region. In this paper, we calculate the phase diagram of the CrMoNbV quaternary system, as well as its constituent binary and ternary subsystems, using a combination of the cluster expansion method and CALPHAD calculations. We further verify these results by carrying out experiments at two different compositions of the full quaternary system. Our work shows how these computational tools can enable efficient discovery and development of new HEAs.}

abstract={Refractory high-entropy alloys (RHEAs) are designed for high elevated-temperature strength, with both edge and screw dislocations playing an important role for plastic deformation. However, they can also display a significant energetic driving force for chemical short-range ordering (SRO). Here, we investigate mechanisms underlying the mobilities of screw and edge dislocations in the body-centered cubic MoNbTaW RHEA over a wide temperature range using extensive molecular dynamics simulations based on a highly-accurate machine-learning interatomic potential. Further, we specifically evaluate how these mechanisms are affected by the presence of SRO. The mobility of edge dislocations is found to be enhanced by the presence of SRO, whereas the rate of double-kink nucleation in the motion of screw dislocations is reduced, although this influence of SRO appears to be attenuated at increasing temperature. Independent of the presence of SRO, a cross-slip locking mechanism is observed for the motion of screws, which provides for extra strengthening for refractory high-entropy alloy system.},

abstract  ="The complex atomic scale structure of high entropy alloys presents new opportunities to expand the deformation theories of mechanical metallurgy. In this regard{,} solute-defect interactions have emerged as critical piece in elucidating the operation of deformation mechanisms. While notable progress has been made in understanding solute-defect interactions for random solute arrangements{,} recent interest in high entropy alloys with short-range order adds a new layer of structural complexity for which a cohesive picture has yet to emerge. To this end{,} this minireview synthesizes the current understanding of short-range order effects on defect behavior through an examination of the key recent literature. This analysis centers on the nanoscale metallurgy of deformation mechanisms{,} with the order-induced changes to the relevant defect energy landscapes serving as a touchstone for discussion. The topics reviewed include dislocation-mediated strengthening{,} twinning and phase transformation-based mechanisms{,} and vacancy-mediated processes. This minireview concludes with remarks on current challenges and opportunities for future efforts."}

abstract={Metallic alloys have played essential roles in human civilization due to their balanced strength and ductility. Metastable phases and twins have been introduced to overcome the strength-ductility tradeoff in face-centered cubic (FCC) high-entropy alloys (HEAs). However, there is still a lack of quantifiable mechanisms to predict good combinations of the two mechanical properties. Here we propose a possible mechanism based on the parameter $\kappa$, the ratio of short-ranged interactions between closed-pack planes. It promotes the formation of various nanoscale stacking sequences and enhances the work-hardening ability of the alloys. Guided by the theory, we successfully designed HEAs with enhanced strength and ductility compared with other extensively studied CoCrNi-based systems. Our results not only offer a physical picture of the strengthening effects but can also be used as a practical design principle to enhance the strength-ductility synergy in HEAs.},
